                                        The previous year has rained many sorrows and miseries in the lives of humankind due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However,
                                        amidst all the suffering, it has also unleashed the artistic fire in us and led to a path of self discovery. From
                                        Dalgona coffee to Instagram reels, we have let loose the child inside us and danced to the colors of joy. But the scars
                                        cannot be healed in a day or two. So in order to recover from the confinement of darkness, Incandescence '21 brings to
                                        all the <strong>Face Painting Competition</strong>. A one of a kind event where your colors transform the human face into an illusory
                                        piece of art. Celebrate the artist in you and let the brush replicate your dreams into reality.

                                    <b>Carpe Diem Nights</b> as called, this module is definitely the one not to be missed. The culmination of four 
                                    days, with lights, music, flashes and the happy vibe, these all define what bliss is.
                                    On a Carpe Diem night, you would basically find your favorite artist on the stage, performing with all 
                                    heart and making your night the happiest one. Don't you worry if that's not your favourite, the night will
                                     reach that level of comfort and gaze that you will remember it forever. That's the magic of Carpe Diem. 
                                     The relishing performances, the unstoppable beats of the bands, the hopping auditorium, what else one needs
                                      to live in the moment, which is not only happening but really existing.

                                        It is indeed surprising to think how music has the potential to evoke laughter, fear and our highest

                                        Someone rightly said that dance is not merely body movement, it is like poetry in motion. With various thoughts,
                                         emotions, expressions and elegant movements, it brings alive in the meaning.<br><br>
                                        In spite of having a strong urge to dance, many of us feel so shy that we restrict ourselves to small rooms.
                                         But with <b>Natraaz</b>, the dance module of Incandescence, there will be ample opportunity to explore ones interest
                                          in dancing. With more than 100 participants from all across the Northeast in last edition, it was just legit!<br><br>
